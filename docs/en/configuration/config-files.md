# Configuration files

Kimi Code CLI writes all long-term preferences — which model to use, which API key to fill in, how many steps an Agent can run per turn — into TOML (a plain-text configuration format with a clear structure) files. Change them once and they take effect on every startup. Agent and runtime settings live in `config.toml`; terminal-UI and client preferences (theme, editor, notifications, auto-update) live in a companion `tui.toml`.

Default location: `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, created automatically on first run.

## Config file location

The CLI reads configuration from `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`. To relocate the data directory, override it with the `KIMI_CODE_HOME` environment variable:

```sh
export KIMI_CODE_HOME=/path/to/kimi-home
```

The config file path then becomes `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`. Regardless of where the directory lives, the file name is always `config.toml`.

::: tip
TOML field names always use snake_case, for example `default_model` and `max_context_size`. If a key contains `.`, you must quote it — for example `[models."gpt-4.1"]` — otherwise TOML treats `.` as a nested table separator.

## Complete example

The following example covers the most commonly used configuration fields. You can copy it and adjust as needed:

```toml
default_model = "kimi-code/kimi-for-coding"
default_thinking = true
default_permission_mode = "manual"
default_plan_mode = false
merge_all_available_skills = true
telemetry = true

[providers."managed:kimi-code"]
type = "kimi"
base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1"
api_key = ""

[models."kimi-code/kimi-for-coding"]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "kimi-for-coding"
max_context_size = 262144

[thinking]
mode = "auto"

[loop_control]
max_retries_per_step = 3
reserved_context_size = 50000

[background]
max_running_tasks = 4
keep_alive_on_exit = false

[experimental]
goal_command = false
micro_compaction = false
background_ask = false

[services.mem9_memory]
base_url = "https://api.mem9.ai"
api_key_env_var = "MEM9_API_KEY"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Read"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "deny"
pattern = "Bash(rm -rf*)"

[[hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
command = "node ~/.kimi-code/hooks/check-bash.mjs"
timeout = 5
```

## Top-level fields

Fields in the config file fall into two categories: **top-level scalars** that directly control default behavior, and **nested tables** (`providers`, `models`, `thinking`, etc.) that each have their own structure, described individually in the sections below.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default_model` | `string` | — | Default model alias; must be defined in `models` |
| `default_thinking` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether new sessions enable Thinking (deep reasoning) mode by default; can be toggled from the model menu inside a session. Even when set to `true`, `[thinking].mode = "off"` will still force Thinking off |
| `default_permission_mode` | `string` | `manual` | Default permission mode for new sessions; one of `manual` (prompt each time), `auto` (auto-approve read operations), or `yolo` (auto-approve everything) |
| `default_plan_mode` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether new sessions start in Plan mode (produce a plan before executing) by default |
| `merge_all_available_skills` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to merge Agent Skills from all available directories |
| `extra_skill_dirs` | `array<string>` | — | Extra skill search directories, layered on top of the default directories |
| `telemetry` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether anonymous telemetry is enabled; disabled only when explicitly set to `false` |
| `providers` | `table` | `{}` | API provider table → [`providers`](#providers) |
| `models` | `table` | — | Model alias table → [`models`](#models) |
| `thinking` | `table` | — | Default parameters for Thinking mode → [`thinking`](#thinking) |
| `loop_control` | `table` | — | Agent loop control parameters → [`loop_control`](#loop_control) |
| `background` | `table` | — | Background task runtime parameters → [`background`](#background) |
| `experimental` | `table` | — | Persistent experimental feature toggles → [`experimental`](#experimental) |
| `services` | `table` | — | Built-in external service configuration → [`services`](#services) |
| `permission` | `table` | — | Initial permission rules → [`permission`](#permission) |
| `hooks` | `array<table>` | — | Lifecycle hooks; see [Hooks](../customization/hooks.md) |

The following sections cover each of the nested tables in turn: `providers`, `models`, `thinking`, `loop_control`, `background`, `experimental`, `services`, and `permission`.

## `providers`

Each entry in the `providers` table defines an API provider, keyed by a unique name. The CLI reads credentials only from here — it does **not** fall back to shell environment variables automatically. Running `export KIMI_API_KEY` in the terminal does not give any provider its key; you must write it explicitly in the config file (see [Config overrides](./overrides.md#provider-credentials)).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | Provider type: `kimi`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `openai_responses`, `google-genai`, `vertexai` |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key, written in plain text in the config file |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | API base URL |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference (`storage` and `key` fields); injected automatically by the login flow — normally no need to write this by hand |
| `env` | `table<string, string>` | No | Fallback source for provider credentials; see below |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

**`env` sub-table**: You can write provider-conventional key names (such as `KIMI_API_KEY`) inside `[providers.<name>.env]` as a fallback source for `api_key` / `base_url`. This sub-table is **read only from the config file** and does not modify the shell environment:

```toml
[providers.kimi.env]
KIMI_API_KEY = "sk-xxx"
KIMI_BASE_URL = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1"
```

Priority: `api_key` field > `env` sub-table key > if both are absent, startup fails with an error.

## `models`

Each entry in the `models` table defines a model alias (the name used in `default_model` or the `-m` flag), keyed by a unique name.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | `string` | Yes | Name of the provider to use; must be defined in `providers` |
| `model` | `string` | Yes | Model identifier sent to the server when calling the API |
| `max_context_size` | `integer` | Yes | Maximum context length in tokens; must be at least 1 |
| `max_output_size` | `integer` | No | Per-request output token cap (maps to `max_tokens`). Currently only the `anthropic` provider honors it; recognized Claude models are automatically clamped to the server-side maximum |
| `capabilities` | `array<string>` | No | Capability tags to add explicitly: `thinking`, `image_in`, `video_in`, `audio_in`, `tool_use`. Unioned with the capabilities auto-detected by the provider — entries can only be added, never removed |
| `display_name` | `string` | No | Name shown in the UI; falls back to `model` when unset |
| `reasoning_key` | `string` | No | `openai` provider only. Override the field name used for reasoning content when the gateway returns it under a non-standard name; by default `reasoning_content`, `reasoning_details`, and `reasoning` are auto-detected |
| `adaptive_thinking` | `boolean` | No | `anthropic` provider only. Force adaptive thinking on or off, overriding the version inference based on the model name. Omit to infer automatically (Claude ≥ 4.6 uses adaptive) |

When an alias contains `.`, use a quoted key:

```toml
[models."gpt-4.1"]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4.1"
max_context_size = 1047576
```

You can also switch models temporarily without touching the config file — by setting `KIMI_MODEL_*` environment variables, the CLI synthesizes a temporary provider in memory that does not persist after restart. See [Define a model from environment variables](./env-vars.md#define-a-model-from-environment-variables-kimi_model).

## `thinking`

`thinking` sets the global default behavior for Thinking mode. `mode = "off"` forces Thinking off even when the top-level `default_thinking = true`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `string` | — | Trigger policy: `auto` (decided by the model), `on` (always on), `off` (force off) |
| `effort` | `string` | `high` | Thinking effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`; the levels actually available depend on the provider |

## `loop_control`

`loop_control` governs the step count limit, per-step retry count, and the threshold that triggers automatic context compaction in the Agent execution loop.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_steps_per_turn` | `integer` | — | Maximum steps per turn; unset or `0` means unlimited |
| `max_retries_per_step` | `integer` | `3` | Maximum retries after a step failure |
| `reserved_context_size` | `integer` | — | Number of tokens reserved for model output; automatic compaction is triggered when the remaining context window falls below this value |

## `background`

`background` controls the concurrency behavior of background tasks (launched via the `Bash` tool or the `Agent` tool's `run_in_background=true` parameter).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_running_tasks` | `integer` | — | Maximum number of background tasks running concurrently |
| `keep_alive_on_exit` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to keep still-running background tasks when the session closes. Set to `false` to request that all background tasks stop before the process exits |

`keep_alive_on_exit` can be overridden by the `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_KEEP_ALIVE_ON_EXIT` environment variable, which takes higher priority than `config.toml`.

## `experimental`

`experimental` stores persistent opt-ins for features that are not public by default yet. You can edit this table directly or run `/experiments` in the TUI. The TUI panel stages changes locally until you confirm them, then writes `config.toml` and reloads the current session. Each TOML key is the experimental flag ID, for example `goal_command`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `goal_command` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable `/goal` and goal-management tools |
| `micro_compaction` | `boolean` | `false` | Trim older large tool results from context while preserving recent conversation |
| `background_ask` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow `AskUserQuestion` to start a background question task when the Agent can continue working |

Environment variables take priority over this table. `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_<NAME>` overrides one feature, and `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG=1` enables all experimental features for that process — see the full list in [Environment variables → Runtime switches](./env-vars.md#runtime-switches). When a feature is controlled by the environment, `/experiments` shows it as locked.

## `services`

`services` configures the built-in external services Kimi Code CLI calls. The recognized keys are `moonshot_search` (web search), `moonshot_fetch` (web fetch), and `mem9_memory` (Mem9 long-term memory). `moonshot_search` and `moonshot_fetch` share these fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | Service API URL |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference, same structure as `providers.*.oauth` |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

```toml
[services.moonshot_search]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/search"
api_key = "sk-xxx"

[services.moonshot_fetch]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/fetch"
api_key = "sk-xxx"
```

`mem9_memory` configures the built-in `Mem9MemorySearch` and `Mem9MemoryStore` tools. If this section is omitted but `MEM9_API_KEY` is set in the environment, Kimi Code enables these tools with the default Mem9 settings. If no API key can be resolved, these tools are not registered. Search reads across Mem9 long-term memory; store writes new content for asynchronous server-side extraction and includes the current Kimi Code session ID as source metadata.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | Mem9 API base URL; defaults to `https://api.mem9.ai` |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | Mem9 API key. Prefer `api_key_env_var` for shared config files |
| `api_key_env_var` | `string` | No | Environment variable used to resolve the Mem9 API key; defaults to `MEM9_API_KEY` |
| `scan_all` | `boolean` | No | Default value for the Mem9 search `scanAll` request parameter |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each Mem9 request |

```toml
[services.mem9_memory]
base_url = "https://api.mem9.ai"
api_key_env_var = "MEM9_API_KEY"
scan_all = false
```

For the default service, this config section can be omitted entirely:

```bash
export MEM9_API_KEY=...
```

## `permission`

`permission` sets permission rules that are automatically loaded when a session starts, controlling whether the Agent needs user confirmation before calling a tool. Rules are written as a `[[permission.rules]]` array of tables, matched in order — the first matching rule takes effect.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | `string` | Yes | Action on match: `allow` (permit immediately), `deny` (reject immediately), `ask` (prompt each time) |
| `scope` | `string` | No | Rule scope: `turn-override`, `session-runtime`, `project`, `user`; defaults to `user` |
| `pattern` | `string` | Yes | Match pattern in the form `ToolName` or `ToolName(arg-pattern)`, e.g. `Read` or `Bash(rm -rf*)` |
| `reason` | `string` | No | Rule description for debugging and auditing |

Built-in tool names are listed in [Built-in tools](../reference/tools.md); MCP tools and custom tools can only be matched by tool name — argument patterns are not supported for them.

```toml
[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Read"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Grep"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "deny"
pattern = "Bash(rm -rf*)"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "ask"
pattern = "Bash"
```

::: tip
MCP server declarations are configured in `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` or the project-local `.kimi-code/mcp.json`, not in `config.toml`. The interactive configuration entry point is `/mcp-config`; see [Model Context Protocol](../customization/mcp.md).
:::

## `tui.toml`

Alongside `config.toml`, the CLI keeps terminal-UI and client preferences in a companion `tui.toml` in the same directory (`~/.kimi-code/tui.toml`, or `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/tui.toml` when overridden). It is created with defaults on first run, and the interactive commands `/config`, `/theme`, and `/editor` write to it for you — so you rarely need to edit it by hand. If the file is malformed, the CLI falls back to defaults and shows a notice instead of failing to start.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `string` | `auto` | Color theme: `auto` (follow the terminal), `dark`, or `light` |
| `[editor].command` | `string` | `""` | External editor command for composing long input; empty falls back to `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` |
| `[notifications].enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether desktop notifications are sent |
| `[notifications].notification_condition` | `string` | `unfocused` | When to notify: `unfocused` (only when the terminal is not focused) or `always` |
| `[upgrade].auto_install` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether new versions are installed automatically |

```toml
# ~/.kimi-code/tui.toml
theme = "auto" # "auto" | "dark" | "light"

[editor]
command = "" # empty uses $VISUAL / $EDITOR

[notifications]
enabled = true
notification_condition = "unfocused" # "unfocused" | "always"

[upgrade]
auto_install = true
```

Changes apply on the next start, or immediately with `/reload-tui` (which reloads only `tui.toml`); `/reload` reloads both `config.toml` and `tui.toml`.
